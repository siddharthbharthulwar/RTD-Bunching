RTD Bus Bunching

The goal of this project is to determine which RTD Denver bus routes are experiencing the highest levels of bus bunching, a negative phenomenon of urban transportation networks. By examining the proximity of buses operating the same routes in the same directions, a statistical model will be developed and presented to RTD officials to drive policy to lessen bus bunching in the Greater Denver Area.
